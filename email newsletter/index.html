            <h2>Edgar Samson</h2>
            <p>"At Samson & Sons, we value leadership that produces results, but also retains our talented staff
                and keeps them motivated to do their aboslute best. The question of what makes a good leader then comes
                down to how does a leader ensure sustainable productivity? We've looked at leaders from a number of largely
                successful companies, along with very mature startups, and found that there are 6 key traits all good
                leaders possess. For this week's newsletter, we've decided to share them with you."

                <h2>Leaders Don't Crave Credit</h2>
                <p>A good leader doesn't mind receiving credit. But their desire to get credit is more concerned with the work at hand
                    and completing it to the best of their ability.

                <h2>More Coach, Less Player</h2>
                <p>The work leaders do is important, but the quality of work from the team is more important. Good leaders care 
                    considerably more about fostering an environment that brings out the best from the team.
